## Market Intelligence

Real-time data and analytics for smarter decision-making.

### Opportunity Detection

**What it does:**
- Scans markets for arbitrage opportunities
- Detects price anomalies across venues
- Identifies trending tokens before they peak
- Monitors whale activity and large transfers

**Use cases:**
- Automated arbitrage bots
- Trend-following strategies
- Early token discovery
- Risk monitoring

**Why it matters:** Agents need more than execution—they need intelligence about what to execute.

### Insider Activity Tracking

**What it does:**
- Monitors wallet patterns for insider signals
- Tracks developer and team token movements
- Identifies suspicious trading activity
- Provides early warning signals

**Use cases:**
- Risk assessment before buying
- Exit signal detection
- Community trust verification
- Research and analysis

**Why it matters:** On-chain data reveals intentions. Agents that can read it gain edge.

### Token Analytics & Scoring

**What it does:**
- Multi-factor token evaluation (liquidity, volume, holders)
- Historical performance metrics
- Social sentiment aggregation
- Risk scoring and classification

**Use cases:**
- Automated token screening
- Portfolio quality assessment
- Due diligence automation
- Strategy backtesting

**Why it matters:** Not all tokens are equal. Agents need tools to separate signal from noise.

### Sentiment Analysis

**What it does:**
- Aggregates social media mentions
- Tracks sentiment shifts in real-time
- Identifies influencer activity
- Detects coordinated campaigns

**Use cases:**
- Early trend detection
- Community health monitoring
- Marketing campaign tracking
- Pump-and-dump identification

**Why it matters:** Price follows narrative. Agents that understand narrative understand price.

## DeFi Primitives

Access to advanced DeFi operations beyond swaps.

### Perpetuals Aggregation

**What it does:**
- Access 400+ perps markets across multiple venues
- Best price execution across platforms
- Position management and tracking
- Cross-venue analytics

**Use cases:**
- Leveraged trading strategies
- Hedging token positions
- Directional bets on markets
- Cross-platform arbitrage

**Why it matters:** Agents need leverage to amplify returns. Perps provide this with capital efficiency.

**Venues included:**
- Hyperliquid
- dYdX
- GMX
- Vertex
- And more

### Prediction Markets

**What it does:**
- Access prediction markets (Polymarket, others)
- Place bets on real-world outcomes
- Track market probabilities
- Identify mispriced predictions

**Use cases:**
- Event-driven trading (elections, sports, etc.)
- Probability arbitrage
- Hedging real-world risk
- Information market participation

**Why it matters:** Prediction markets aggregate information. Agents can extract alpha from collective intelligence.

### Lending & Borrowing

**What it does:**
- Access lending protocols (Aave, Compound)
- Deposit assets to earn yield
- Borrow against collateral
- Manage loan positions

**Use cases:**
- Yield farming strategies
- Leveraged positions
- Capital efficiency optimization
- Collateral management

**Why it matters:** Idle capital earns nothing. Agents can put capital to work automatically.

### Liquidity Provision

**What it does:**
- Automated LP position management
- Impermanent loss monitoring
- Fee optimization across pools
- Rebalancing strategies

**Use cases:**
- Market making
- Yield generation
- Range-bound strategies
- Protocol incentive farming

**Why it matters:** Providing liquidity generates fees. Agents can manage this more efficiently than humans.

## Agent-to-Agent Services

Infrastructure for agents to provide services to other agents.

### Strategy Marketplaces

**What it does:**
- Agents can list trading strategies as entrypoints
- Other agents can subscribe and execute
- Revenue sharing through x402
- Performance tracking and reputation

**Use cases:**
- Monetize successful strategies
- Access proven strategies without building
- Diversify by using multiple strategy agents
- Competitive strategy marketplace

**Why it matters:** Edge shouldn't die when shared—it should become a product. Strategy marketplaces enable this.

**Example:**
```
Agent A: Has profitable arbitrage strategy
Agent B: Wants to trade but lacks strategy
Agent A: Wraps strategy as entrypoint, charges $0.01/call
Agent B: Pays per use, executes strategy
Agent A: Earns revenue from multiple subscribers
```

### Signal Sharing

**What it does:**
- Agents can broadcast trading signals
- Other agents can subscribe to signals
- Pay-per-signal or subscription model
- Signal quality metrics and tracking

**Use cases:**
- Share alpha without revealing full strategy
- Aggregate signals from multiple sources
- Build signal-following bots
- Create signal reputation systems

**Why it matters:** Signals have value. x402 makes them programmable and tradeable.

### Custom Model Endpoints

**What it does:**
- Agents can expose trained models as entrypoints
- Other agents pay to access predictions
- Specialized models for specific tasks
- Performance-based pricing

**Use cases:**
- Price prediction models
- Risk assessment models
- Sentiment classification
- Custom analytics

**Why it matters:** Models trained on specific data have value. Agent-to-agent model access unlocks AI marketplaces.

### Coordination Tools

**What it does:**
- Multi-agent coordination primitives
- Shared state management
- Event coordination
- Resource pooling

**Use cases:**
- Cooperative trading strategies
- Liquidity coordination
- Information sharing networks
- Decentralized agent teams

**Why it matters:** Some problems require multiple agents working together. Coordination tools enable this.

## Cross-Chain Expansion

Expanding x402 infrastructure beyond Base.

### Bridge Integration

**What it does:**
- Move assets across chains seamlessly
- Best route finding across bridges
- Safety checks and validation
- Cost optimization

**Why it matters:** Liquidity is fragmented across chains. Agents need unified access.

### Multi-Chain Routing

**What it does:**
- Find best prices across all chains
- Execute cross-chain swaps
- Manage multi-chain portfolios
- Unified position tracking

**Why it matters:** The best opportunity might not be on the chain you're on. Agents shouldn't be chain-locked.

### Universal Liquidity Access

**What it does:**
- Aggregate liquidity from all chains
- Single interface for cross-chain DeFi
- Automatic chain selection
- Unified x402 payment

**Why it matters:** Infrastructure should abstract away complexity. Agents should think about operations, not chains.

## Enhanced Discovery & Analytics

Tools for finding and evaluating entrypoints.

### Entrypoint Search & Filtering

**What it does:**
- Search by category, cost, popularity
- Filter by use case or capability
- Sort by reputation or usage
- Discover trending entrypoints

**Why it matters:** As entrypoints grow, discovery becomes critical. Agents need to find the right tool quickly.

### Reputation Systems

**What it does:**
- Track entrypoint reliability
- Usage statistics and trends
- User reviews and ratings
- Performance metrics

**Why it matters:** Trust is earned through history. Reputation helps agents choose quality services.

### Performance Analytics

**What it does:**
- Track your entrypoint usage
- Cost analysis and optimization
- ROI calculation per entrypoint
- Strategy performance attribution

**Why it matters:** You can't optimize what you don't measure. Analytics turn data into insights.

### Entrypoint Composition Tools

**What it does:**
- Visual workflow builders
- Chain entrypoints into strategies
- Template libraries for common patterns
- Testing and simulation

**Why it matters:** Composability is powerful but complex. Tools make it accessible.

<Tip>
The entrypoint ecosystem grows through usage. The more agents use entrypoints, the more developers build them. The more entrypoints exist, the more capable agents become. This is infrastructure that compounds.
