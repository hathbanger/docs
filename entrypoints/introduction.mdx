## What Are Entrypoints?

Entrypoints are **x402-powered API endpoints** that provide specific capabilities to AI agents. Each entrypoint does one thing well, and agents combine them into sophisticated workflows.

Think of entrypoints as **Lego blocks for agent operations**:
- Each block is simple
- Blocks snap together easily
- Complex structures emerge from combination
- Anyone can create new blocks

**Current entrypoints:**
- Token operations (create, buy, sell)
- Universal swap (any ERC20 token)
- Market data (listings, positions, prices)

**Coming soon:**
- Market intelligence
- DeFi primitives (perps, predictions, lending)
- Agent-to-agent services

---

## Why Entrypoints?

### For Agents

**Pay-per-call beats subscriptions:**
- No monthly fees for unused services
- Pay only for actual usage
- Budget optimizes automatically
- Scale up or down freely

**Standard interface everywhere:**
- Learn x402 once, works for all entrypoints
- Same authentication pattern
- Consistent JSON format
- Predictable error handling

**Composability unlocks sophistication:**
- Chain multiple entrypoints together
- Create complex workflows from simple parts
- Each new entrypoint multiplies possibilities
- Build once, reuse everywhere

### For Builders

**Monetize your services:**
- Wrap any service as x402 entrypoint
- Set your own pricing
- Earn revenue per call
- Scale to unlimited users

**Network effects:**
- Enable 10% referral fees
- Users promote your service
- More usage = more revenue
- Platform handles discovery

**Open infrastructure:**
- No approval needed
- No listing fees
- Deploy anywhere
- Keep your independence

## How Agents Use Entrypoints

### Via CLI

```bash
# Token operations
httpcat create "My Token" "MTK"
httpcat buy MOON 0.10
httpcat sell MOON 50%

# Universal swap
httpcat swap 0xUSDC 0xWETH 1000000

# Market data
httpcat list --sort mcap
httpcat positions
```

### Via MCP (AI Assistants)

```
User: "What are the top 5 tokens by market cap?"
Claude: [Calls token_list entrypoint with sort=mcap, limit=5]
Claude: "Here are the top 5 tokens: ..."

User: "Buy $0.10 of the newest one"
Claude: [Calls token_buy entrypoint]
Claude: "Purchased 150,000 MOON tokens for $0.10"
```


### Via API (Direct HTTP)

```bash
POST https://agent.402.cat/entrypoints/token_buy_0_10/invoke
Headers:
  PAYMENT-SIGNATURE: <x402_signature>
  Content-Type: application/json
Body:
  {"identifier": "MOON", "amount": 0.10}
```

## Composing Entrypoints

The power of entrypoints comes from **composition**—combining multiple entrypoints into workflows.

### Example 1: Automated Trading Bot

```typescript
// 1. Monitor market (free)
const tokens = await client.invoke('token_list', {
  sort: 'volume',
  limit: 10
});

// 2. Analyze candidates ($0.001)
for (const token of tokens) {
  const info = await client.invoke('token_info', {
    identifier: token.address
  });

  // 3. Execute if criteria met (variable)
  if (meetsStrategy(info)) {
    await client.invoke('token_buy_0_10', {
      identifier: token.address,
      amount: 0.10
    });
  }
}

// 4. Track positions (free)
const positions = await client.invoke('token_positions');
```

**Four entrypoints. One strategy. All automatic.**

### Example 2: Portfolio Rebalancer

```typescript
// 1. Get current holdings (free)
const positions = await client.invoke('token_positions');

// 2. Calculate imbalance
const { sells, buys } = calculateRebalance(positions);

// 3. Execute sells ($0.01 each)
for (const sell of sells) {
  await client.invoke('token_sell', {
    identifier: sell.token,
    amount: sell.amount
  });
}

// 4. Execute buys via swap (variable)
for (const buy of buys) {
  await client.invoke('universal_swap', {
    tokenIn: 'USDC',
    tokenOut: buy.token,
    amountIn: buy.amount
  });
}
```

**Two entrypoints. Complex portfolio management.**

### Example 3: Token Launch + Marketing

```typescript
// 1. Create token ($0.01)
const token = await client.invoke('token_create', {
  name: 'My Token',
  symbol: 'MTK',
  website: 'https://mytoken.io'
});

// 2. Initial buy ($0.10)
await client.invoke('token_buy_0_10', {
  identifier: token.address,
  amount: 0.10
});
```

**Two entrypoints. Complete launch workflow.**

## Cost Structure

### How Pricing Works

Each entrypoint has its own pricing:
- **Fixed cost:** Same price every call (e.g., $0.01)
- **Variable cost:** Based on operation size (e.g., trading fees)
- **Free:** No payment required (e.g., market data queries)

**Example costs:**
```
Token creation: $0.01
Token info: $0.0001
Token buy: $0.05 - $200 (based on amount)
Token sell: $0.01 + 1% trading fee
Universal swap: Variable + gas + DEX fees
Chat lease: $0.01 per 10 minutes
```

### Fee Distribution

When you call a paid entrypoint:
- **Entrypoint creator** gets 70-90% (for custom entrypoints)
- **Platform** gets 10-20% (development and infrastructure)
- **Referrer** gets 10% (if present)

**Example: $0.10 token buy**
```
$0.10 → Trade execution
1% trading fee → $0.001
Platform fee → CAT buyback
Referrer (10%) → $0.01 if referral code used
```

See [Fee Structure](/concepts/fees) for complete details.

## Discovery

### Finding Entrypoints

**Via API:**
```bash
GET https://agent.402.cat/entrypoints
```

**Via CLI:**
```bash
httpcat entrypoints list
httpcat entrypoints search "market data"
```

**Via MCP:**
```
User: "What entrypoints are available for trading?"

## Key Concepts

### Pay-Per-Call

Agents pay for exactly what they use, when they use it. No subscriptions. No minimums.

**Benefit:** Budget optimizes automatically. High-value operations get more spend. Low-value operations get less.

### Composability

Each entrypoint is a primitive. Agents compose primitives into sophisticated workflows.

**Benefit:** As entrypoints grow, possibilities multiply exponentially. 5 entrypoints = dozens of workflows. 50 entrypoints = thousands.

### Standard Interface

All entrypoints use x402 authentication. Learn once, works everywhere.

**Benefit:** Agents don't need custom integration per service. Same pattern for all operations.

### Network Effects

Referral system (10%) incentivizes users to promote entrypoints they use.

**Benefit:** Valuable entrypoints grow organically through word-of-mouth and agent recommendations.

<Tip>
Entrypoints are infrastructure, not features. Each one is simple. The sophistication comes from composition. As the ecosystem grows, agents become more capable without code changes—they just discover and use new entrypoints.
