description: "The complete journey of a token from creation to graduation"
---

## Overview

Every token on 402.cat follows the same lifecycle: **Creation → Trading → Graduation**. Understanding this journey helps you make better decisions about when to create, buy, or sell.

## The Five Stages

## Stage 1: Creation

### Creating a Token

Anyone can create a token for **$0.01 USDC**:

```bash
httpcat create "Moon Cat" "MOON" --website https://mooncat.io
```

**What happens:**
1. **Smart contract deployed** with your parameters
2. **Initial state set**:
   - Total supply: 1,000,000 tokens
   - Real tokens: 793,100 (79.31% for trading)
   - LP reserve: 206,900 (20.69% for graduation)
   - Virtual reserves initialized
3. **Bonding curve activated**
4. **Token address assigned** (ends in `402`)

**Initial Conditions:**
- Market cap: $6.90 (testnet) or $6,900 (mainnet)
- Price: ~$0.0000069 (testnet)
- Status: `active`
- Available for trading immediately

<Tip>
Your token address ends in `402` for easy identification!
</Tip>

## Stage 2: Active Trading

### On the Bonding Curve

Tokens trade on the constant product bonding curve:

**Buying drives price up:**
- Users add USDC, receive tokens
- `real_tokens` decreases
- `virtual_usdc` increases
- Price increases automatically

**Selling drives price down:**
- Users return tokens, receive USDC
- `real_tokens` increases
- `virtual_usdc` decreases
- Price decreases automatically

**Key Metrics:**
- **Price**: Determined by virtual reserves (`virtual_usdc / virtual_tokens`)
- **Market Cap**: Price × total supply
- **Graduation Progress**: `(initial_real_tokens - real_tokens) / initial_real_tokens`
- **Liquidity**: All `real_usdc` available

### Trading Dynamics

**Early Stage** (0-25% graduation progress):
- Low price, high risk
- Small trades have minimal price impact
- Volatile - can reverse quickly
- Creator and early buyers accumulating

**Mid Stage** (25-75% graduation progress):
- Rising price if community is strong
- More holders, more liquidity
- Price impact becoming noticeable
- Community building momentum

**Late Stage** (75-100% graduation progress):
- Near graduation, high excitement
- Large trades have significant impact
- Last chance to buy on curve
- Airdrop anticipation

---

## Stage 3: Approaching Graduation

### The Final Push

As `real_tokens` approaches zero:

**At 90% Progress:**
- Only 79,310 tokens left (10% of original)
- Price has increased significantly
- Market cap approaching threshold
- Community excitement building

**At 99% Progress:**
- Only 7,931 tokens left (1% of original)
- Very high price
- Imminent graduation
- FOMO intensifies

**Trading Behavior Changes:**
- **Buyers**: Racing to get in before graduation
- **Sellers**: Some taking profits, others holding for airdrop
- **Price Impact**: Every trade moves the price noticeably
- **Volume**: Typically highest near graduation

### Graduation Trigger

When the last token is bought:
```
real_tokens == 0
```

Graduation process begins automatically within 30 seconds.

## Stage 4: Graduation

### Automatic Graduation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detection">
    Background monitor detects `real_tokens == 0`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Status Change">
    Token status: `active` → `graduating`

    New buys rejected during this phase
  </Step>

  <Step title="Airdrop">
    **LP Reserve Distribution** (206,900 tokens):
    - Proportionally distributed to all holders
    - Based on your % of circulating supply
    - Example: 1% of supply → receive 2,069 airdrop tokens
  </Step>

  <Step title="LP Creation">
    **Uniswap V4 Pool**:
    - CAT/Token pair created
    - Liquidity added using `real_usdc` + LP tokens
    - 80% LP locked forever
    - 20% LP to creator
  </Step>

  <Step title="Completion">
    Token status: `graduating` → `graduated`

    Trading now happens on Uniswap V4 only
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Duration:** Typically 1-5 minutes depending on network conditions.

### What You Receive

**As a Holder:**
- ✅ Your original tokens (unchanged)
- ✅ Airdrop tokens (~26% more)
- ✅ LP fee share (33% of trading fees)

**As the Creator:**
- ✅ 20% of LP position (unlocked)
- ✅ 33% of all hook fees
- ✅ Ongoing revenue from trading

**Example:**
```
You bought: 10,000 tokens for $0.20
Circulating: 793,100 tokens
Your share: 1.26%

Airdrop: 10,000 × (206,900 / 793,100) = 2,608 tokens
New total: 12,608 tokens
Your % of supply: 1.26% (unchanged)
```

## Stage 5: V4 Trading

### Post-Graduation

**Trading Location:** Uniswap V4 only

**How to Trade:**
```bash
# CLI automatically detects graduated tokens
httpcat buy MOON 0.10   # Routes to V4
httpcat sell MOON 50%   # Routes to V4

# Or use Uniswap directly
# Swap USDC → CAT → MOON
```

**Fee Structure:**
- Hook fee: ~0.3%
- Creator: 33%
- Platform: 33%
- LPs: 33%

**Price Discovery:**
- Market-driven (no bonding curve)
- Deeper liquidity for larger trades
- Subject to normal DEX dynamics
- Influenced by overall market conditions

### Claiming Fees

**Creators:**
```bash
# View claimable fees
httpcat claim MOON

# Claim fees
httpcat claim MOON --execute
```

**LP Holders:**
- Fees accumulate in V4 position automatically
- Claim via Uniswap V4 interface
- Can compound by adding more liquidity

## State Transitions

| Current State | Trigger | Next State |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Not created | `create_token` | `active` |
| `active` | `real_tokens == 0` | `graduating` |
| `graduating` | Airdrop complete | `graduated` |
| `graduating` | Error | `failed` (rare) |
| `graduated` | N/A | Permanent |
| `failed` | Admin fix | `active` or `graduated` |

**Permanent States:**
- `graduated`: Cannot return to bonding curve
- Token trades on V4 forever
