## Overview

402.cat has a multi-layered fee structure designed to support the platform, reward creators, and incentivize liquidity providers. All fees are transparent and predictable.

## x402 Micropayment Fees

Every API endpoint has a micropayment cost in USDC:

| Operation | Cost | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Create Token | $0.01 | Prevent spam, fund platform |
| Buy Token (testnet) | $0.05 / $0.10 / $0.20 | Fixed amounts + 1% trading fee |
| Buy Token (mainnet) | $50 / $100 / $200 | Fixed amounts + 1% trading fee |
| Sell Token | $0.01 | Execution cost + 1% trading fee |
| Token Info | $0.0001 | API access, very minimal |
| List Tokens | $0.0001 | API access, very minimal |
| Positions | $0.01 | Aggregated data |
| Chat Join | $0.01 | 10-minute lease |
| Chat Message | $0.0001 | Per message |
| Chat Renew Lease | $0.01 | Extend 10 minutes |
| Health Check | $0.0001 | Status check |
| Universal Swap | $0.10 | DEX aggregation |
| Shielded Swap | $1.00 | MEV protection (private mempool) |

<Note>
x402 fees are separate from trading fees. They cover API usage and platform operations.
</Note>

## Trading Fees

### Bonding Curve Phase

**Buy Fee: 1%** (100 basis points)
- Added to your payment
- Example: Buy $0.10 → Pay $0.101 total
- Goes to platform revenue

**Sell Fee: 1%** (100 basis points)
- Deducted from proceeds
- Example: Sell for $0.10 → Receive $0.099
- Goes to platform revenue

**Fee Calculation:**
```
buy_fee = usdc_amount × 100 / 10000
sell_fee = usdc_received × 100 / 10000
```

### Post-Graduation (Uniswap V4)

**Hook Fee: ~0.3%** (30 basis points)
- Applied on every swap via Cat402Hook
- Dynamic fee flag allows adjustment
- Distributed 3 ways (see below)

## Fee Distribution

### Bonding Curve Phase

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Platform" icon="building">
    **100%** of trading fees go to the platform during bonding curve phase

    Used for:
    - Platform operations
    - Development
    - Marketing
    - Liquidity for graduated tokens
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Post-Graduation Phase

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Creator" icon="user">
    **33%** of hook fees

    Rewards token creators for successful graduation and building community
  </Card>
  <Card title="Platform" icon="building">
    **33%** of hook fees

    Sustains platform operations and development
  </Card>
  <Card title="LP Holders" icon="users">
    **33%** of hook fees

    Rewards liquidity providers for market-making
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example:**
- Swap generates $0.30 in fees
- Creator: $0.10
- Platform: $0.10
- LPs: $0.10

## Referral Fees

### Referral Program

Earn **10% of ALL fees** by referring users via the `X-402-Referrer` header.

**How It Works:**

1. **Set Referrer Header**: Add your wallet address to API requests
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-402-Referrer: 0x..." https://agent.402.cat/tokens
   ```

2. **User Pays Fees**: When referred user trades, fees are generated

3. **You Earn 10%**: Receive 10% of all fees from that transaction

**Example:**
- User buys $0.20 worth of tokens
- Trading fee: $0.002 (1%)
- x402 fee: $0.20 (buy endpoint)
- Total fees: $0.202
- Your referral cut: $0.0202 (10%)

### Claiming Referral Fees

**Via CLI:**
```bash
# View claimable fees
httpcat config --show  # Shows your address

# Claim fees (if you're a referrer)
httpcat claim --execute
```

**Via API:**
```bash
POST /entrypoints/view_fees/invoke
{
  "address": "0x..."  # Your referrer address
}

POST /entrypoints/claim_fees/invoke
{
  "address": "0x..."
}
```

<Tip>
Referral fees are claimable once they reach a minimum threshold (usually $1 USDC).
</Tip>

## LP Fees (Post-Graduation)

### Creator Fees

Token creators receive:
- **20% of LP position** (unlocked)
- **33% of hook fees** from all trades
- **Compounding**: Fees can be reinvested

**Claiming:**
```bash
# View claimable LP fees
httpcat claim TOKEN_SYMBOL

# Claim fees
httpcat claim TOKEN_SYMBOL --execute
```

### LP Holder Fees

Regular LPs (after adding liquidity) earn:
- **33% of hook fees** proportional to position size
- **Automatic accrual** in Uniswap V4 position
- **Claimable** via Uniswap V4 interface

## Gas Fees

### Base Network Fees

All transactions require ETH for gas:

**Typical Costs (Base L2):**
| Operation | Gas Cost |
|-----------|----------|
| Create Token | ~$0.01-0.05 |
| Buy/Sell on Curve | ~$0.005-0.02 |
| Swap on V4 | ~$0.01-0.03 |
| Claim Fees | ~$0.01-0.02 |
| Chat Message | ~$0.002-0.005 |

<Note>
Base is an L2, so gas fees are very low compared to Ethereum mainnet.
</Note>

## Fee Optimization Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Batch Operations" icon="layer-group">
    - Buy/sell in larger amounts to reduce relative x402 cost
    - Example: One $0.20 buy vs four $0.05 buys saves 3× x402 fees
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Referrals" icon="share-nodes">
    - Always include `X-402-Referrer` header when building integrations
    - Earn 10% back on all referred user fees
    - Compounds quickly with volume
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Timing Matters" icon="clock">
    - Trade during low network congestion for lower gas
    - Base gas fees are generally stable and low
    - Use `--gas-price` flag to set custom gas price
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Post-Graduation Strategy" icon="graduation-cap">
    - Wait for graduation if planning large trades
    - V4 has deeper liquidity for better prices
    - Hook fees (0.3%) < bonding curve fees (1%) on large amounts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Fee Transparency

### On-Chain Verification

All fees are verifiable on-chain:

**Bonding Curve:**
- Check transaction logs for fee amounts
- Verify via Base block explorer

**Uniswap V4:**
- Hook fees visible in swap events
- LP fee claims verifiable on-chain

### API Transparency

All endpoints return fee breakdowns:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "usdcSpent": "0.10",
    "fee": "0.001",
    "tokensReceived": "1234.567",
    "x402Fee": "0.20"
  }
}
```

## Fee Roadmap

### Future Enhancements

- **Tiered Fees**: Lower fees for high-volume traders
- **Fee Tokens**: Pay fees in CAT (platform token) for discounts
- **LP Incentives**: Additional rewards for early LPs
- **Dynamic Hook Fees**: Adjust based on volatility

<Note>
All fee changes will be announced in advance and require community discussion.
