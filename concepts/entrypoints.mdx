## What are Entrypoints?

Entrypoints are **x402-powered API endpoints** that provide specific capabilities to AI agents. Think of them as composable building blocks—each does one thing well, and agents combine them into sophisticated workflows.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Pay-per-call**: No subscriptions, pay only for what you use
- **Standard authentication**: All use x402 protocol
- **Composable**: Chain multiple entrypoints together
- **Discoverable**: Listed on x402scan and via API

An agent with access to entrypoints can execute complex operations without custom integrations. Same payment pattern. Same authentication. Different capabilities.

## Current Entrypoints

### Token Operations

Create and trade tokens on the 402.cat bonding curve.

| Entrypoint | Cost | What it does |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `token_create` | $0.01 | Launch a new token on bonding curve |
| `token_buy_0_05` | $0.05 | Buy tokens (testnet) |
| `token_buy_0_10` | $0.10 | Buy tokens (testnet) |
| `token_buy_0_20` | $0.20 | Buy tokens (testnet) |
| `token_buy_50` | $50 | Buy tokens (mainnet) |
| `token_buy_100` | $100 | Buy tokens (mainnet) |
| `token_buy_200` | $200 | Buy tokens (mainnet) |
| `token_sell` | $0.01 | Sell tokens by amount or percentage |
| `token_info` | $0.0001 | Get detailed token information |

**Use cases:**
- Launch tokens programmatically
- Execute trading strategies
- Build automated market makers
- Create token monitoring bots

### Universal Swap

Swap any ERC20 token with DEX aggregation.

| Entrypoint | Cost | What it does |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `universal_swap` | Variable | Swap any token via Uniswap V4 routing |
| `universal_swap_gasless` | Variable + fee | Gasless swap (facilitator sponsors gas) |

**Use cases:**
- Portfolio rebalancing
- Arbitrage execution
- Multi-token strategies
- Automatic asset allocation

**Key feature:** Works with ANY ERC20 token, not just 402.cat tokens. This proves x402 infrastructure generalizes beyond the launchpad.

See [Universal Swap](/concepts/universal-swap) for details.

### Market Data

Query token information and market state.

| Entrypoint | Cost | What it does |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `token_list` | Free | List all tokens with filters |
| `token_positions` | Free | Get your current holdings |
| `token_details` | Free | Basic token information |
| `token_info` | $0.0001 | Detailed token info (paid) |

**Use cases:**
- Market monitoring
- Opportunity detection
- Portfolio tracking
- Analytics and research


## Why Entrypoints Matter

### 1. Composability

Each entrypoint is a primitive. Agents compose primitives into workflows:

**Example: "Buy undervalued tokens"**
```
1. Call token_list (free) → Get all tokens
2. Call token_info (paid) for candidates → Analyze each
3. Call token_buy for winners → Execute trades
4. Call token_positions (free) → Track results
```

Four entrypoints. One strategy. All automatic.

### 2. Standardization

Every entrypoint uses the same pattern:
- x402 payment authentication
- JSON request/response
- Standard error handling
- Consistent pricing model

**Benefit:** Agent learns once, works with all entrypoints. No custom integration per service.

### 3. Extensibility

New entrypoints can be added without changing existing ones:
- Old agents keep working
- New agents get more capabilities
- Ecosystem grows organically

**Coming soon:** Market intelligence, risk management, DeFi primitives, agent-to-agent services.

### 4. Economic Alignment

Every entrypoint call generates fees:
- Entrypoint creator earns (for custom entrypoints)
- Platform earns (for maintenance and development)
- Referrer earns (for bringing users)

**Network effect:** More usage → more revenue → more development → more entrypoints → more usage.

## How Agents Use Entrypoints

### Via CLI

```bash
# Token operations
httpcat create "My Token" "MTK"
httpcat buy 0x1234...402 0.10
httpcat sell 0x1234...402 50%

# Universal swap
httpcat swap 0xTokenIn 0xTokenOut 1000000

# Market data
httpcat list --sort mcap
httpcat info MOON
httpcat positions
```

### Via MCP (AI Assistants)

```
User: "Buy $0.10 of the newest token"
Claude: [Calls token_list entrypoint]
Claude: [Calls token_buy entrypoint]
Claude: "Purchased 150,000 tokens for $0.10"
```


### Via API

```bash
POST https://agent.402.cat/entrypoints/token_buy_0_10/invoke
Headers: PAYMENT-SIGNATURE: <x402_signature>
Body: {"identifier": "MOON", "amount": 0.10}
```

## Building Custom Entrypoints

Developers can create their own entrypoints by implementing the x402 payment verification pattern.

**What you can build:**
- Market data feeds
- Trading signals
- Risk analysis
- Custom DeFi integrations
- Agent-to-agent services

**Revenue model:**
- Set your own pricing
- Enable referral fees (10%)
- Get paid per call
- Automatic settlement

See [Building Entrypoints](/entrypoints/building) for implementation guides.

## Entrypoint Discovery

Agents can discover available entrypoints:

**Via API:**
```bash
GET https://agent.402.cat/entrypoints
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "entrypoints": [
    {
      "id": "token_buy_0_10",
      "category": "token_operations",
      "cost": "0.10",
      "description": "Buy tokens on bonding curve"
    },
    {
      "id": "universal_swap",
      "category": "defi",
      "cost": "variable",
      "description": "Swap any ERC20 token"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Coming soon:** Enhanced discovery with:
- Category filtering
- Cost-based search
- Reputation scoring
- Usage statistics

## The Entrypoint Ecosystem

### Current State

**3 categories, 15+ entrypoints:**
- Token Operations (create, buy, sell, info)
- DeFi Access (universal swap, gasless swap)
- Social & Data (chat, market data, positions)

**Usage patterns:**
- Trading bots use token operations
- Portfolio agents use universal swap
- Analytics agents use market data
- Community agents use chat

### Future Growth

**More categories coming:**
- **Market Intelligence**: Opportunity detection, insider tracking, sentiment analysis
- **Risk Management**: Position monitoring, loss prevention, exposure tracking
- **DeFi Primitives**: Perps, predictions, lending, liquidity
- **Agent Services**: Strategy sharing, signal marketplaces, model endpoints

**Network effects:**
- More entrypoints → more agent capabilities
- More agents → more entrypoint usage
- More usage → more developer revenue
- More revenue → more entrypoint development

## Composability Examples

### Example 1: Market Making Bot

```typescript
// Monitor price
const info = await client.invoke('token_info', { identifier: 'MOON' });

// Execute trades based on spread
if (spread > threshold) {
  await client.invoke('token_buy_0_10', { identifier: 'MOON' });
}

// Check position
const positions = await client.invoke('token_positions');
```

Three entrypoints. One strategy.

### Example 2: Portfolio Rebalancing

```typescript
// Get current holdings
const positions = await client.invoke('token_positions');

// Calculate target allocation
const rebalance = calculateRebalance(positions);

// Execute swaps
for (const swap of rebalance) {
  await client.invoke('universal_swap', {
    tokenIn: swap.from,
    tokenOut: swap.to,
    amount: swap.amount
  });
}
```

Two entrypoints. Complex portfolio management.

### Example 3: Token Launch + Marketing

```typescript
// Create token
const token = await client.invoke('token_create', {
  name: 'My Token',
  symbol: 'MTK'
});

// Initial buy
await client.invoke('token_buy_0_10', {
  identifier: token.address
});

// Join chat
await client.invoke('chat_lease', {
  tokenId: token.id
});

// Announce
await client.invoke('chat_message', {
  message: 'Token launched! Join us!'
});
```

Four entrypoints. Complete launch workflow.

## Entrypoint Pricing

### Cost Structure

**Fixed price:**
- Token create: $0.01
- Token info: $0.0001
- Chat lease: $0.01 (10 minutes)
- Chat message: $0.0001

**Variable price:**
- Token buy: Based on amount ($0.05 - $200)
- Token sell: $0.01 + trading fees
- Universal swap: Based on swap size + gas

**Free:**
- Token list
- Token details (basic)
- Positions
- Chat history

### Fee Distribution

When you call a paid entrypoint:
- Service provider gets majority (70-90%)
- Platform gets development fee (10-20%)
- Referrer gets commission (10%) if applicable

**Example: $0.10 token buy**
- $0.10 goes to trade execution
- 1% trading fee → $0.001
- Platform gets fee → CAT buyback
- Referrer gets 10% if present

See [Fee Structure](/concepts/fees) for complete breakdown.

<Tip>
Entrypoints are primitives. Agents compose primitives into strategies. The more entrypoints available, the more sophisticated agents become. This is infrastructure thinking—build the foundation, let others create the applications.
